## Introduction: 
<p align="justify">Loans default will cause huge loss for the banks, so they pay much attention to this issue and apply various methods to detect and predict the default behaviors of their customers. In this blog, I am going to talk about the process of prediction good/bad loans with machine learning algorithms.</p>


## Information About Lending Club:
<p align="justify">Lending Club is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, in which investors provide funds for potential borrowers and investors earn a profit depending on the risk they take the borrower's credit score). Lending Club provides the "bridge" between investors and borrowers.</p> For more information, click on the link: [**Lending Club**](https://www.lendingclub.com/company/about-us) 

#### Look at the data:

## Project Description:
<p align="justify">Lending Club data set contains the complete loan data for all Lending Club loans issued through year 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Charge off, Fully Paid, etc.) and the latest payment information. Each of the entries in the data set is based on the previous completed calendar quarter. We are interested in predicting whether the loan will end up in "Good" ("Fully Paid", "Current", or 'Does not meet the credit policy. Status:Fully Paid") or "Bad" the rest of loan status.</p>


## Project Approach:

These are the steps that I followed:-

#### 1) Data Cleaning:
<p align="justify">I started by cleaning the data and fill the nan value by either the mean value or by zero and this depends on the feature.</p>


#### 2) Exploratory Data Analysis:

In the second step, I started to visualize the data and take a look on the target column.

<p align="justify">As you can see that there are unbalanced data in my target column. the good loan is approximately 91% and the bad loan is approximately 8%. So, we need to balance them to have good prediction.</p>

<p align="justify">As you can see the unbalncing between my two classes in the target column comes mainly from current class in the loan status since it is cover approximately 61% of the data.</p>

<p align="justify">You can see from the figure above the distribution of the grade feature in my data set. After visualizing the data, I started to divide some columns into classes such as address state into the region and annual income into income categories. The two figures below show how the new columns' data are distributed.</p>

#### 3) Modeling:

<p align="justify">In this step, I started to develop multiple models such as Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and I chose the best model to test the data on it. The best model was when I took a random sample from the majority class (Good loan) and made it the same length as the minority class (Bad loan). This made my model more accurate and gave me better results than SMOTED data. So, I will show only the best model that I got which was by using Random Forest.</p>

<p align="justify">We can see from the three figures above the confusion matrix, the result, and the ROC curve. We can see that the ROC curve gives us a good curve and the accuracy is approximate to 63% which is good for my situation.</p> 

<h4>4) Testing The Chosen Model:</h4>

<p align="justify">This is the test result that I got which is similler than what I got in validation which means that I didn't have overfitting. The three figures below verify that.</p>

## Conclusion and Future Work:

<p align="justify">We have successfully built a machine learning algorithm to predict good/bad loans. We might want to look at other techniques to improve the prediction power of the algorithm in the future work.</p>
