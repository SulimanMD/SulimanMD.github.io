title: Third Project - Predicting Good/Bad Loans
---
## Introduction: 
<p align="justify">Loans default will cause huge loss for the banks, so they pay much attention to this issue and apply various methods to detect and predict the default behaviors of their customers. In this blog, I am going to talk about the process of prediction good/bad loans with machine learning algorithms.</p>


## Company Information:
<p align="justify">Lending Club is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, in which investors provide funds for potential borrowers and investors earn a profit depending on the risk they take the borrower's credit score). Lending Club provides the "bridge" between investors and borrowers.</p> For more information, click on the link: [**Lending Club**](https://www.lendingclub.com/company/about-us)

## Project Approach:

These are the steps that I followed:-

#### 1) Data Cleaning:



#### 2) Exploratory Data Analysis:

In the second step, I started to visualize the data and take a look on the target column.

<p align="justify">As you can see that there are unbalanced data in my target column. the good loan is approximately 91% and the bad loan is approximately 8%. So, we need to balance them to have good prediction.</p>

<p align="justify">As you can see the unbalncing between my two classes in the target column comes mainly from current class in the loan status since it is cover approximately 61% of the data.</p>

You can see from the figure above the distribution of the grade in my data set.


<p align="justify">After visualizing the data, I started to divide some columns into classes such as address state into the region and annual income into income categories. The two figures below show how the new columns' data are distributed.</p>

#### 3) Modeling:

In this step, I started to develop multiple model and chose the best one to test my test-data on it.
