title: Second Project - Predicting Riyadh House Prices Using Linear Regression
---
## Project Goal:
```
My goal in this project was to use linear regression in order to
estimate the sale price of a house in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia by 
using eSimsar website database.
```

### Look at the **eSimsar website**

## Project Overview:
In this project, I am going to develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from [**eSimsar**](https://www.esimsar.com/). Once I get an excellent model fit, I am going to use this model to predict the monetary value of a house located in Riyadh's area.
